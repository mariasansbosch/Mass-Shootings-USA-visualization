# üß† US Mass Shootings Visualization with Altair & Streamlit

## üìä Project Overview

This project provides an **interactive visual analysis of mass shootings in the US** using data from the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/). Built with **Altair** and **Streamlit**, the application offers an intuitive dashboard to explore key trends and correlations in gun violence data, especially mass shootings across states and counties, school incidents, and trends over time.

The goal of this project is to design **explanatory visualizations** that help users understand how mass shootings are distributed and evolving in the United States.

## üîç Key Questions Answered

1. **Which US states have the highest number of mass shootings per citizen?**
2. **How is the number of mass shootings per citizen distributed across US counties and states?**
3. **Are mass shootings correlated with gun violence in schools?**
4. **How have mass shootings evolved over the past years in the US?**

Each question is addressed with one or more visualizations and concise explanations of the design process, decisions, and insights drawn.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Two datasets were used:
- **Mass Shootings Dataset**
- **School Shootings Dataset**

Both datasets were cleaned and, where needed, augmented to support comparative and time-series analysis. The data cleaning process is fully documented to ensure reproducibility.

## üìà Visualizations

For each question, charts were created with thoughtful design choices to improve clarity, legibility, and effectiveness. Key considerations include:
- Choosing appropriate chart types (e.g., choropleth maps, bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs)
- Reducing visual clutter
- Using consistent color schemes and legends
- Facilitating quick comparisons and highlighting key patterns

Each visualization includes a written explanation (‚â§200 words) detailing the design process.

## üß© Final Dashboard

The project culminates in a **comprehensive visualization dashboard**, integrating all charts and analyses into a single **Streamlit app**. Special care was taken to ensure:
- Visual consistency across charts
- Cohesive styling and layout
- Smooth user interaction
